This is the scala-openjdk S2I image:
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

This S2I Image uses sbt assembly (https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) to create a fat jar.
So your application has to include the assembly sbt plugin.

Sample invocation:

s2i build <source code path/URL> scala-openjdk <application image>

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run <application image>
